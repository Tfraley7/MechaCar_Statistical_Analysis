## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The Pr(>|t|) points to the probability that the coefficients within the data frame may contribute to a random variance amongst this model. Zach (2021) the Pr(>|t|) column exemplifies the p-value when analogous with the t value column. At this moment, one would want to understand if the coefficient's values in the Pr(>|t|) column are greater or less than 0.05. When analyzing the results spoiler_angle (Pr(>|t|) = 0.3069) and AWD (Pr(>|t|) 0.1852) were unlikely to be random.

The p-value of this data sset is 5.35e-11 which means that the significance level is smaller than 0.05%. Knowing this one can validate that there is enough evidence to support that the slope of the linear model is not zero.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
To better understand if the linear model is predicting mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. It would be important to refer to the r-squared value. The r-squared value is 0.7149. This allows for the data set to be effectively predicted 71 out of 100 times.
